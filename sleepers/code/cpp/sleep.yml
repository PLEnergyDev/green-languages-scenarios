    Simple benchmark that sleeps for exactly one second per iteration.
    Used for testing framework measurement accuracy.
code: |

    #include <signals.h>

    int main(int argc, char **argv) {
        while (1) {
            if (!start_gl()) break;
            sleep(1);
            end_gl();
        }
