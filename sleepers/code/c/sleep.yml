description: |
    Simple benchmark that sleeps for exactly one second per iteration.
    Used for testing framework measurement accuracy.
code: |
    #include <unistd.h>
    #include <measurements.h>

    int main(int argc, char **argv) {
        while (1) {
            if (!start_measurement()) break;
            sleep(1);
            end_measurement();
        }
        return 0;
    }
