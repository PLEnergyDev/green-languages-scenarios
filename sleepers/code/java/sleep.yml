    Simple benchmark that sleeps for exactly one second per iteration.
    Used for testing framework measurement accuracy.
code: |
    public class Program {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Signals signals = new Signals();
            while (true) {
                if (signals.startGl() == 0) break;
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(1000);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                }
                signals.endGl();
            }
